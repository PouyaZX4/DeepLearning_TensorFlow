# DeepLearning with TensorFlow

This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of my journey in learning deep learning using TensorFlow. It contains the paths I've taken and the various projects I've worked on to solidify my understanding of this powerful framework.

## What You'll Find Here

This repository includes edits and files inspired by and built upon the knowledge gained from the following valuable resources:

* **Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow** (by Aurélien Géron)
* **Machine Learning for Coders with fastai & PyTorch** (adapted for TensorFlow concepts)
* **TensorFlow Zero to mastary: Data and Deployment Specialization** (by deeplearning.ai and taught by Daniel Burke)

Within this repository, you'll discover:

* **Organized Project Directories:** Each project or learning module is typically contained within its own directory, making it easy to navigate and understand the context.
* **Code Examples:** Practical implementations of deep learning concepts using TensorFlow and Keras.
* **Adaptations and Modifications:** My personal edits and extensions to the code examples from the aforementioned resources, reflecting my learning process and experimentation.
* **Potentially:** (You can add more specific details here if applicable, e.g., "Notebooks exploring different neural network architectures," "Scripts for data preprocessing and visualization," "Examples of deploying TensorFlow models.")

## How This Repository Can Help You

While this repository primarily documents my learning journey, it might be beneficial for others who are also starting or progressing in their deep learning studies with TensorFlow. You can potentially find:

* **Practical Examples:** See how theoretical concepts are translated into working TensorFlow code.
* **Different Learning Approaches:** Observe how concepts from various learning resources are integrated and applied.
* **Ideas for Your Own Projects:** Get inspiration for projects you can undertake to learn and practice deep learning.

## Getting Started

You can explore the different directories and code examples within this repository. Each directory may contain its own README file with more specific information about the project or topic covered.

## Contributions

As this repository mainly reflects my personal learning journey, I am not actively seeking contributions at this time. However, if you have any questions or spot any issues, feel free to open an issue, and I'll do my best to respond.
